**Orbilib**

Versatile and utilizable library made in early 2022 by Gaurav Bansal.
It can simulate orbits and orbital mechanics (currently only in circular form)

The library calculates most of the confusing and complex values for you so you can easily retrieve them.
You can create your own orbital systems by creating custom barycenters and custom satellites with their own masses.

The simulation only provides numerical data through terminal but soon will account for visuals.
