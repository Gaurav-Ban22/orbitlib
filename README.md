**Orbilib**

Versatile and utilizable library made in early 2022 by Gaurav Bansal.
It can simulate orbits and orbital mechanics, as you can pass in values of time in seconds to determine the orbital position and angle of the orbiting body.

Currently, Orbilib is in progress and will only work with circular orbits.

The library calculates most of the confusing and complex values for you so you can easily retrieve them.
You can create your own orbital systems by creating custom barycenters and custom satellites with their own masses.
Orbilib can print the statistics and data of the orbital system when given a certain time value in seconds. For example, the angle of the orbiting body, or the satellite, will be given in radians and degrees.

The simulation only provides numerical data through terminal but soon will account for visuals.
